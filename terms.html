      These flashcards summarise the key terms of using the Trading Places prototype.
      They are written in plain language for testing purposes and are not a full legal
      agreement. In a production system, a formal Terms of Service document would also apply.

        This prototype records your choices in training scenarios to calculate an empathy
        score and to generate anonymised statistics. Individual answers are not shown to
        your line manager or peers. HR and programme owners may see only aggregated,
        de-identified results.

      <div class="tc-tag">Card 2</div>
      <div class="tc-title">Role-based access</div>
      <p>
        Employees see only their own training progress and scores. Managers see anonymised
        insights for their team. HR sees organisation-wide trends, also anonymised. No role
        can access raw, named scenario choices for another individual through this prototype.

      <p>
        Trading Places is currently a prototype. Content, scores, and interfaces may change
        without notice. Scenario results are intended for learning and reflection only and
        should not be used as formal performance ratings or disciplinary evidence.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- CARD 4 -->
    <div class="tc-card">
      <div class="tc-tag">Card 4</div>
      <div class="tc-title">Respectful use</div>
      <p>
        Scenarios may include sensitive themes such as bias, discrimination, and exclusion.
        By using this prototype you agree to engage respectfully and to follow your
        organisation’s code of conduct when discussing or sharing scenario content.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data stored
        in this prototype environment by contacting the project owner or Data Protection
        Officer. In a live deployment, formal processes under GDPR and other applicable
        laws would apply.
