      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        This Culture Readiness Report is generated from anonymised, mock data
        collected through immersive scenarios in the Trading Places prototype.
        It is designed for demonstration and teaching purposes only and does
        not represent a real organisation.

    <section class="card mt-3">
      <div class="card-title">Key Strengths</div>

      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        <strong>1. High completion of mandatory training</strong><br>
        72% of staff have completed the full DEI training pathway, indicating
        strong engagement with the programme and effective communication from
        HR and line managers.
      </div>

      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        <strong>2. Solid empathy baseline</strong><br>
        The average empathy index of 69% suggests that most employees can
        recognise biased situations and consider more than one perspective
        before acting.
      </div>

      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        <strong>3. Positive response to scenario learning</strong><br>
        Qualitative comments (not shown in this mock-up) indicate that staff
        value the ability to “swap perspectives” and understand how their
        decisions land on others.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card mt-3">
      <div class="card-title">Priority Risks &amp; Gaps</div>

      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        <strong>1. Uneven empathy scores across teams</strong><br>
        The Engineering and Trading &amp; Markets teams show lower median
        empathy scores than Operations. This may point to differences in
        local leadership culture or workload pressures.
      </div>

      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        <strong>2. Allyship behaviours lag behind awareness</strong><br>
        While recognition of bias is relatively strong, allyship behaviours
        (e.g., speaking up, supporting colleagues, challenging unfair decisions)
        are less frequent in the scenarios.
      </div>

      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        <strong>3. Psychological safety is inconsistent</strong><br>
        Employees are more likely to choose “avoidant” options in scenarios
        where power dynamics are strong (for example, challenging a senior
        leader or a long-standing team norm).
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card mt-3">
      <div class="card-title">Recommended Actions (Prototype)</div>

      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        <strong>Short term (0–3 months)</strong><br>
        • Use scenario content in existing team meetings and away days to
        normalise conversations about bias and inclusion.<br>
        • Encourage managers to share their own learning journeys and “mistakes”
        to model growth mindsets.<br>
        • Identify 2–3 “quick win” policy or process changes that address
        common patterns from scenarios (for example, structured interview
        questions or clearer meeting norms).
      </div>

      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        <strong>Medium term (3–12 months)</strong><br>
        • Develop a set of allyship micro-skills (e.g., asking clarifying
        questions, naming behaviour, inviting quieter voices) and embed them
        into performance conversations.<br>
        • Extend the Trading Places scenario library to cover issues such as
        disability inclusion, hybrid working, and cross-cultural collaboration.
      </div>

      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        <strong>Long term (12+ months)</strong><br>
        • Integrate culture-intelligence metrics into organisational dashboards
        alongside operational KPIs.<br>
        • Periodically refresh scenarios to reflect evolving legal, social, and
        organisational contexts.
      </div>

    <section class="card mt-3">
      <div class="card-title">Legal &amp; Ethical Considerations</div>

      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        This prototype is designed with reference to GDPR, the Equality Act
        2010, and the Public Sector Equality Duty. It uses mock, anonymised
        data only and does not collect or process real employee records.
      </div>

      <div class="small-text mt-2">
        In a production deployment, the organisation would need to complete a
        full Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), update privacy notices,
        and ensure that scenario content and analytics do not disadvantage
        protected groups.
